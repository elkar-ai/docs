## What is Elkar?

Elkar facilitates seamless communication, coordination, and task orchestration among autonomous agents, enabling developers to build collaborative multi-agent systems effortlessly. 

It handles the complexity of your infrastructure so your agents can focus on what matters: **working together.**

Elkar provides:

- üêç**A Python SDK**  (other languages coming soon) to build and connect AI agents using the A2A protocol with store and queue management.
- üñ•Ô∏è **A web-app** and API to manage, monitor and debug agent tasks.

It allows  AI agents to:

- **Send and receive tasks**: Agents can dispatch tasks to one another using standardized A2A messages.
- **Track long-running tasks**: Monitor the status of tasks in real-time, ensuring asynchronous operations
- **Browse and manage task history** for observability and debugging

## Why Using Elkar?

- **Simplified Agent Communication**: Elkar abstracts the complexities of inter-agent communication, allowing developers to focus on agent logic rather than protocols.
- **Task Management**: Designed to handle numerous agents and tasks at the same time, making it suitable for large-scale deployments.
- **Open Source**: Join a growing community of developers contributing to and benefiting from Elkar's capabilities.
