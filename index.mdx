Elkar is an open-source task management platform designed for AI agents, built upon Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. It facilitates seamless communication, coordination, and task orchestration among autonomous agents, enabling developers to build collaborative multi-agent systems effortlessly.

## What is Elkar?

Elkar provides a robust infrastructure that allows AI agents to:

- **Send and receive tasks**: Agents can dispatch tasks to one another using standardized A2A messages.
- **Track task progress**: Monitor the status of tasks in real-time, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Orchestrate complex workflows**: Coordinate multiple agents to work together towards a common goal.

By leveraging the A2A protocol, Elkar ensures interoperability between agents, regardless of their underlying frameworks or platforms.

## Why Use Elkar?

- **Simplified Agent Communication**: Elkar abstracts the complexities of inter-agent communication, allowing developers to focus on agent logic rather than protocols.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle numerous agents and tasks at the same time, making it suitable for large-scale deployments.
- **Extensible and Modular**: Easily integrate with existing systems and extend functionalities as needed.
- **Open Source**: Join a growing community of developers contributing to and benefiting from Elkar's capabilities.
